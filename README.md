Test of Web Full Stack for EarthPulse

I've studied an introduction for NextJS and used it as a reference for the test.
The two scripts that are used are `index.js` and `posts/formulario`.

The first one is a main page that can redirect to the second one, with a user name and password input.
Then, I've studied and tried to use Firebase for the user's autenticathion, but it is not implemented, making the user return to the main page when trying to log in.

It also has two links for the deployment with Vercel and another to its website.
